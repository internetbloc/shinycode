The To-Do List
=============

Key Features
------

	Filesystem API-RPC:
	- Simple universal features (This file no longer exists but is still in the editor.. Reload/Save/etc..)
	- Watch / Update Tree Model

Design Elements
------

	Window Manager API:
	- Create wrapper control for all terminal / code editor elements on the page, so placement is handled by positioning a div element over a given tracked divs position. This allows more flexibility for
	custom window tiling / stacking.
